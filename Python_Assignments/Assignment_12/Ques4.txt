#Ques 4. What is a difference between library and API . Figure it out with examples.

# Library.............


Python library is a collection of functions and methods that allows you to perform lots of actions without writing your own code.

For example, if you are working with data, numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. are the libraries you must know. They have very convenient
data transformation functions that will save you life time to do small tricks.

You might take 1 hour to finish writing a script for a certain data transformation and the script takes O(n^3) time to run. 
Then, it is highly possible that there exists a library that contains this function and runs in O(n).

Also if you are doing web development, there are libraries that will save you much much more time in your development.

For a list of standard libraries: The Python Standard Library, there are a lot of new libraries coming out.

If you are stuck at some point and developing a script might be time consuming, look for library functions that can do your job
on the Internet first (stackoverflow is a good place), you would almost always be able to find one. Even you didn't, stackoverflow
 would have lots of scripts in answers that can do similar tricks, which will save you time as well.
 
 
 
# API(Application Programming Interface........)


Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, are commonly used to retrieve data from remote websites. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, and
Facebook all offer certain data through their APIs. To use an API, you make a request to a remote web server, and retrieve the data
you need.

 APIs are useful in the following cases:

The data is changing quickly. An example of this is stock price data. It doesn't really make sense to regenerate a dataset and download
it every minute -- this will take a lot of bandwidth, and be pretty slow.
 
You want a small piece of a much larger set of data. Reddit comments are one example. What if you want to just pull your own comments on
Reddit? It doesn't make much sense to download the entire Reddit database, then filter just your own comments.
 
There is repeated computation involved. Spotify has an API that can tell you the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create
your own classifier, and use it to categorize music, but you'll never have as much data as Spotify does.
