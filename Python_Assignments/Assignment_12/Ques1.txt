# Access Token.....

The Access Token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API.

It can be any type of token (such as an opaque string or a JWT) and is meant for an API. Its purpose is to inform the API that the bearer of this token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions (as specified by the scope that has been granted).

The Access Token should be used as a Bearer credential and transmitted in an HTTP Authorization header to the API.
